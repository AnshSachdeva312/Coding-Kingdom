#  SmartFix – Blockchain-Powered Fault Detection & Resolution System

**SmartFix** is a decentralized, AI-powered platform designed to detect, report, and resolve system/device issues with trust, transparency, and automation. Built during **Hackstasy 2025** in 24 hours, SmartFix fuses **blockchain security** with **AI intelligence** for next-gen fault management.

##  Inspiration
Traditional fault-reporting systems are often opaque and centralized. We wanted to build something **transparent, intelligent, and secure** — where issue logs are tamper-proof, and AI does the heavy lifting for diagnostics.

##  Key Features
-  **Blockchain-Based Issue Logging (Immutable Records)**
-  **AI Diagnostics via OpenAI API**
-  **Smart Suggestions for Instant Fixes**
-  **Decentralized User Feedback Collection**
-  **Admin Dashboard for Monitoring Issues**
